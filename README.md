# MSP-Sphero-Pilot--Chirpy
Project Chirpy is a collaborative enjoyment platform for students who need distraction from studying.

Week 1:
This week we received the Sphero 2.0 in the mail and began brainstorming ideas for the project. We had to revise our initial idea, since it involved the use of a camera (which Sphero does not have). In the end, we came up with the idea for Project Chirpy: Using Twitter, students present in the library at University of Denver will be able to control things like Sphero's direction of movement and color by sending in tweets. 

Week 2:
This week we were able to find the Sphero SDK and add it to our GitHub repository. Due to finals and the onset of Spring Break we were only able to meet for a limited amount of time.
